Description: Implements v2 of the B.L.S. API for requests of survey information
  and time series data through 3-tiered API that allows users to interact with
  the raw API directly, create queries through a functional interface, and
  re-shape the data structures returned to fit common uses. The API definition 
  is located at: <https://www.bls.gov/developers/api_signature_v2.htm>.
